Technical To-Do List ‚öôÔ∏è
Here is a revised, detailed technical to-do list for your game project, incorporating all your feedback, especially the focus on modularity for easy expansion by a new programmer.

Server-Side Tasks üíª
1. Project Setup & Core Logic
Initialize the Server: Set up a Node.js server using a library like ws for WebSockets to handle communication with clients.

Chunk Data Storage: Implement a simple, file-based storage system. Create a data folder on the server. Each chunk will be a separate JSON file (e.g., chunkA.json, chunkB.json). This keeps the data simple, understandable, and free.

ChunkManager Module: This module will be responsible for handling all chunk-related logic.

Load/Unload Logic: Implement a cache or in-memory map to hold active chunks.

Timeout: Set a 30-second timer for each loaded chunk. If no clients are present when the timer expires, the chunk is written to disk and removed from memory.

Data Serialization: Create a function to serialize the chunk's state into a JSON string and a function to deserialize it from the JSON file.

2. Player & Communication Management
PlayerManager Module: This module will manage all connected clients and their location.

Player List: Maintain a list of all connected players.

Chunk-Specific Lists: Maintain a map or dictionary where the keys are chunk IDs, and the values are lists of players currently in that chunk.

Periodic Check-In: Implement a timer to request a "check-in" message from all clients in a chunk once every minute. If a client doesn't respond, assume they have disconnected (e.g., due to a crash) and remove them from the chunk's list.

WebSocket Endpoints: Define specific message types (e.g., join_chunk, request_box_change) and implement listeners to handle incoming messages from clients.

Client List Broadcasting: When a player joins a server, joins a new chunk, or leaves a chunk, broadcast the updated list of players in that chunk to all clients in that chunk. Do not broadcast if the list has not changed.

Client-Side Tasks üïπÔ∏è
1. Core Systems & Rendering
Base Game Setup: Continue building out your core game systems as planned (e.g., TerrainSystem, CharacterSystem, InputManager).

SceneManager Module: This module will handle rendering logic and ensure that only the current chunk is loaded.

Scene Clearing: Implement a function to unload all assets and objects related to the previous chunk before loading the new one. This keeps the memory footprint low.

ObjectFactory Module: To support your goal of easy feature addition, create a modular system for game objects. For instance, a function createObject(type, model, texture) could be used for creating trees, bushes, and boxes by simply passing in different parameters.

2. Networking Modules
ServerConnection Module: A dedicated module for all server-client communication.

Message Handlers: Implement functions to handle server broadcasts like player_list_update and chunk_state_change.

Send Messages: Create functions to send messages to the server, such as request_box_change or request_chunk_switch.

P2PConnectionHandler Module: A separate module to handle all peer-to-peer communication.

Connect/Disconnect: Implement logic to initiate WebRTC connections to new peers as they appear on the player_list_update and to close connections when peers leave the chunk list.

Send Data: Create a function to send a message like flash_box to all connected peers.

Receive Data: Implement a listener to handle incoming data channel messages from peers.

Development Workflow
Start Simple: Begin by implementing the server-side file storage and the client's ability to load a single, hardcoded chunk file.

Build the Core Loop: Add the client-server communication for Place/Remove Box and ensure the server updates its file.

Add P2P: Implement the client list broadcasting and the peer-to-peer connections for the "Flash Box" feature.

Refactor for Modularity: As you add more features, move reusable code into dedicated modules to keep the project organized.
